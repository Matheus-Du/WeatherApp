# WeatherApp
Weather application created using Python, tkinter, and selenium.

The program starts by prompting the user to input a home city, then displays that city on a new home screen.
From there the user can enter new locations that will appear under the 'locations' tab using the entry box on the right side.

The program uses selenium to scrape weather and temperature data from Google, and tkinter to display the data on a UI.

If the user has previously entered a home city, the program remembers the city and any locations previously added
and displays all this data when the user runs the program.
